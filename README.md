### Building the code
You can find more information on how to set up your development environment [here](./docs/SetUpDevEnv.md).

#### 2. Open the solution in visual studio
- Use the `src/AccessibilityInsights.sln` file to open the solution.

#### 3. Build and run unit tests

#### 4. Build the MSI project
The MSI project is used to package all the code into an installer that can be used to install Accessibility Insights for Windows. This is not a required step. By default the MSI project is not built in either configuration.
Note: The MSI can only be built in the `Release` config.
- The MSI project requires WIX. WiX is a modern SDK that restore will automatically download from NuGet. Learn about the Wix toolset from http://wixtoolset.org/.
- To build the MSI locally, set build configuration to `Release`.
- Find the MSI project in the solution explorer under the `packages` folder.
- Right click on the MSI project and select `Build`.
- Once the build is complete, the MSI can be found at `\src\MSI\bin\Release`.
